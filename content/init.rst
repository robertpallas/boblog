:summary: Robert starts blogging

Hello World! I am Robert, 26-year-old web developer hailing from `Tallinn, Estonia
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallinn>`_. As a man with way too many hobbies and interests I greatly enjoy sporting activities as both active and passive participant, writing, strategic board games and creating software amongst other things.

This blogging site will focus mostly on my technical explorations. Topics include Bitcoin, personal projects and programming ideas. Purpose is to strengthen my online presence as a developer, try out Pelican with Github Static Pages and create a log for my travels in all things tech.

More about me can be found at about me page that I am about to create. Maybe.

Viva la boblog!
