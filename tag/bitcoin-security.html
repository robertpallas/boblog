</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>My first contact with Bitcoin happened somewhere on second half of year 2011 after first bubble had already burst. I was fascinated
by financial properties but digging deeper I found the real beauty of Bitcoin - how cryptographic primitives are combined to create a
financial system where no central authority has to be trusted. Although I immediately saw promise in long term success of decentralized
crypto-currencies I did not foresee such fast growth and gains for early investors as the graphs of Bitcoin flickered unpredictably but so far
in undeniably upwards motion. Monetary value and EUR/USD price of Bitcoin are indeed topics I would like to discuss in my blog but acknowledging
the fact that any kind of predictions and evaluations are at this point just a little shy of being meaningless I might stick to technical explorations. I encourage
people to look at Bitcoin as revolutionary experiment in world of finance - one that may pave a path to bigger changes in our societies
economic behavior and therefore refactor social systems as a whole. If you do have any interest in Bitcoin please do yourself a favor and try to understand
the basics of technologies the system is built on.</p>
<p>During studies in Tallinn University of Technology and Tartu University joint program in Cyber Security I used Bitcoin as a topic in several
assignments including my Master's thesis titled <a class="reference external" href="includes/btc-thesis.pdf">Bitcoin Security</a>. The paper seeks to guide readers into understanding how such a complex and
ambitiously promising system can be secured against hacking attempts that any system of significant value faces. It walks readers through most important
concepts of Bitcoin and their ingenious combination to build a safe web of mitigations for threats and ensure that properties that may seem as
weaknesses at first glance are actually part of clever bigger picture design. Since defending the paper in
summer 2012 much has changed in Bitcoins ecosystem and services built on top of it have become way more professional. At the same time the strong security
discussed in the paper has remained constant for Bitcoin itself and will continue at that in foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Another earlier paper I wrote analysis Bitcoin by fitting its properties into model called Financial Cryptography in 7 Layers by Ian Grigg.
Although I failed to answer what gives Bitcoin value (in short: growing demand for currency that gives so many great properties as medium of exchange and
value storage combined with its possible wide adoption in future) and some of the points are outdated it may be of interest for fitting Bitcoin
into a framework that was created a decade before it to measure possible success of financial crypto-systems and easily comes up successful.
